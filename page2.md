<h2>Advanced UI Designs</h2>

<!--Introduction to the lesson part 1-->

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The goal of advanced UI design makes interfaces that are easy to navigate and allow users to access information and features easily. 

Modern applications are complex and advanced today and uses an array of features and functions. It is important to create an easy to understand so users can quickly navigate the interface.

The interfaces will be used through a variety of devices: phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, ect. Meaning the interfaces have to be responsive to these screen sizes and orientations.

Navigation is important since it can have impact on user satisfaction and retention. Users are more likely to use an application if they are able to navigate and it meets their needs effectively. This can lead to high ratings, reviews, and in some cases increase revenue.

Learning these concepts can greatly improve the design of your own interface</p>

<h3>Analyze UI Design Elements</h3>

<p>Key elements of UI design</p>

<p>Micro-interactions: Small, preferably functional animations that support the user by giving visual feedback and displaying changes more clearly.
Examples: Preloader, Chat bots, Celebratory Gifs
Animations: Technique used to bring still images to life by creating illusion of motion through series of images displayed in rapid succession
Examples:
Visual Feedback:</p>

<p>Here are some examples of interfaces that has used these elements listed above effectively [LINK] LINK LINK</p>
<!--ask students 'how effective are these examples and point to some of the elements shown on the interfaces'-->

<h3>Animations Through Code</h3>
<p>Now that we analyzed some of the elements of UI, lets go over animation in code.</p>
<!--Animations can be created through code and students will be learning how to code basic animation-->
